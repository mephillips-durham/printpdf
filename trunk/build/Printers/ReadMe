"PDF" is an alternative printer definition for !Printers, based on the PoScript2 definition, which allows the use of a custom PDF Printer sprite with !Printers on the iconbar when using PostScript2.  The single file replaces the separate "PDF300" and "PDF600" definitions, since the specified resolutions make no difference to the PS2 drivers.

The Sprites directory contains suitable sprites use on RISC OS 3 and RISC OS 4 machines; RISC OS 5 already has such sprites included in the ROM.  The RISC OS 3 sprites were originally supplied with Taborca (and will already be present on a machine with this installed); the RISC OS 4 sprites were designed by Richard Hallas.

See the main documentation for more details of installation.
